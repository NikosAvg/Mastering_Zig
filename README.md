# Mastering Zig

Welcome to my Zig learning repository! This is where I upload and organize the code I write while exploring the **Zig programming language**. Whether you're learning Zig yourself or just curious about my journey, feel free to browse, learn, and contribute!

## üìù About Zig
[Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is a general-purpose programming language designed for robustness, optimal performance, and maintainability. Some of its standout features include:

- Manual memory management.
- No hidden control flow or allocations.
- Cross-compilation made easy.

This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with these features and more.
